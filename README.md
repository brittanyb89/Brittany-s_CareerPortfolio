# Brittany's Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this portfolio is to capture the skills that were learned in bootcamp and put into one place so that employers can evaluate my talents and determine if I am a great candidate for their company. This helps employers not only read about the work that I have done, but also gives them the ability to view my capabilities. I learned in the process of building this portfolio that there are several ways to code, but there's always room to simplify, clean up, and improve.
